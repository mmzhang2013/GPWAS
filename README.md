# Data Preparation
## Genotype Data

**Gene**: Keep the title of this item as "Gene" and do not change it. All of gene names were kept below it.
**SNP**: Keep the title of this item as "SNP" and do not change it. The format of SNP should be written as "S"+chromosome+"\_"+SNP position.
**Sample**: Individual sample name. 
**Note**: All items should be split by \tab

| Gene | SNP | Sample1 | Sample2 | Sample3 |
| :---: | :---: |:---: |:---: | :---: |
|Zm00001d000501|S3_27396852| 0 | 1 | 0 |
|Zm00001d000501|S3_27397388| 0 | 2 | 1 |
|Zm00001d000632|S3_156234383| 0 | 1 | 1 |
|Zm00001d000632|S3_156234434| 1 | 2 | 1 |
|Zm00001d000654|S3_178548901| 2 | 1 | 1 |

## Phenotype Data

**Pheno** Name of phenotype name.
**Sample** Individual sample name.
**Note**: All items should be split by space.

| Taxa | Pheno1 | Pheno2 | Pheno3 |
| Sample1 | 23 | 50 | 55 |
| Sample2 | 10 | 12 | 8 |
| Sample3 | 120 | 150 | 133 |
